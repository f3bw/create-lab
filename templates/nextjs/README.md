# Youwe (Headless) Frontend Accelerator

The Headless Accelerator is Youwe's best-practise scaffolding to enable customer teams to build fast, scalable Next.js applications.

## Introduction

Youwe is a large company with a lot of customers (and a lot of customer teams), with numerous Next.js-based projects under active development at any one time. With a wide ecosystem of tooling, libraries and project structures available, React developers can follow very different paths to achieve the same outcome. For Youwe it is important that we maintain a consistent and logical shared codebase across our projects.

The Headless Accelerator aims to ensure that every project is:

- Easy to get started
- Simple to understand and maintain
- Using the right tools
- Everyone on the team is on the same page when it comes to how things are done
- Performant
- Scalable in terms of codebase and team size

## Introduction

- Showcases the project structure recommended for all projects
- Uses Youwe coding standards and formatting rules, such as eslint and prettier
- Recommended libraries for adding frequently-used functionality such as localisation and form validation
